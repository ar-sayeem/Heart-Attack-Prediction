# Heart Attack Prediction

### Overview

Heart Attack Prediction is a Tkinter-based GUI application that leverages a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on user-provided medical inputs. The application provides an intuitive interface for entering health parameters and generates a detailed PDF report of the results. Currently, the project is being developed to create an executable file for easy deployment and use on computers.

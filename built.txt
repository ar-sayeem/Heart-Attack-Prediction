Age                 - Age in years
Sex                 - Sex [Male / Female]
Cp                  - Chest pain type (Typical angina; Atypical angina; Non-anginal pain; Asymptomatic)
Trestbps            - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg [Normal BPS 60 to 100] on admission to the hospital)
Chol                - Serum Cholestoral in mg/dl
Fbs                 - Fasting blood sugar > (Normal 120 mg/dl) [Yes / No]
Restecg             - Resting electrocardiographic results [Normal / Having ST-T / Hypertrophy]
Thalach             - Maximum heart rate achieved
Exang               - Exercise induced angina [Yes / No]
Oldpeak             - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope               - The slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Upsloping / Flat / Downsloping]
Ca                  - Number of major vessels [0-3] colored by flourosopy
Thal(Thalassemia)   - [Normal / Fixed defect / Reversable defect]


Restecg represents the resting electrocardiographic result. 

Thalach denotes the maximum heart rate achieved. 

Exang indicates exercise-induced angina, recorded as 1 in case of pain and 0 if there is none. 

Oldpeak reflects the ST depression induced by exercise. 

Slope signifies the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. 

Ca represents the number of major coronary vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.

Thalach represents the maximum rate is based on your age, as subtracted from 220. So for a 50-year-old, maximum heart rate is 220 minus 50, or 170 beats per minute.
